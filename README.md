# A Collection of Random files

Sometimes, especially when working with Google Collab, I needed some of my files.
And I naively thought that setting up a public github repo would be a good idea.
It is not.
Unfortunately, quite a lot of my older Google collab notebooks rely on this files, so I didn't want to make the repo private.
